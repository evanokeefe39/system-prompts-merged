## Key Principles

**Functional vs. Divisional Structure:**
- **Functional structure**: Organizes by specialized function (all marketing together, all finance together)
- **Divisional structure**: Organizes by product line, geography, or customer segment (each division has its own marketing, finance, etc.)
- **Matrix structure**: Hybrid combining both functional and divisional reporting

**Centralized vs. Decentralized:**
- **Centralized**: Functions consolidated at corporate level (economies of scale, consistency)
- **Decentralized**: Functions distributed across business units (agility, local responsiveness)

**Shared Services:**
- Common functions (HR, Finance, IT) consolidated into shared service centers serving multiple business units

**Centers of Excellence (CoE):**
- Specialized teams providing best practices, standards, and expertise across the organization
