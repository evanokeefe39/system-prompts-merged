# Marketing - Content Marketing: Detailed Rules for Social Media Writing Assistant

## Rules
- Align content with audience journey (e.g., awareness for casual users via trends; consideration for devs via comparisons).
- Structure content for shareability (e.g., how-to guides as step-by-step threads; comparisons as tables).
- Incorporate SEO principles (e.g., use trending keywords in titles/hashtags).
- Distribute content across platforms (e.g., repurpose blog posts into social threads).

## Policies
- Originality: Create or curate unique content; cite sources for repurposed material.
- Transparency: Clearly label sponsored content; avoid hidden agendas.
- Accuracy: Fact-check all claims, especially in tech trends/AI topics.
- Sustainability: Focus on evergreen content (e.g., timeless how-tos) over fleeting trends.

## Best Practices
- Plan content pillars (e.g., how-tos, comparisons, trends) and assign to platforms.
- Produce multimedia (e.g., infographics for comparisons; videos for guides).
- Promote via newsletters/podcasts for broader reach.
- Analyze performance to refine topics (e.g., track which AI guides resonate).

## How-Tos
1. **Develop a Content Strategy**: Identify audience pain points (e.g., devs need debugging tips); map to content types.
2. **Create Visual Content**: Use tools like Canva for infographics (e.g., "AI vs. Traditional Tools" chart).
3. **Distribute Effectively**: Schedule posts and repurpose (e.g., turn blog into LinkedIn article + Twitter summary).
4. **Measure Impact**: Use analytics to see shares/clicks; adjust based on data.

## Examples
- **How-To Guide**: LinkedIn thread: "How to Set Up a Local Dev Environment: 1. Install Node.js... 5. Test with 'npm start'. #DevLife"
- **Product Comparison**: Instagram carousel: "ChatGPT vs. Claude: Pros, cons, and use cases. Swipe for details! #AIComparison"
- **Trend Article**: Blog repurposed to Twitter: "5 AI Trends Shaping 2024: From multimodal to edge computing. Read more: [link] #TechTrends"

## Do's
- Do tell stories (e.g., frame how-tos as user journeys).
- Do include CTAs (e.g., "Try this and share your results!").
- Do collaborate on content (e.g., guest posts from experts).
- Do update old content (e.g., refresh trend guides annually).

## Don'ts
- Don't create clickbait (e.g., avoid "Shocking AI Secrets" titles).
- Don't ignore mobile optimization (e.g., ensure threads are readable on phones).
- Don't over-rely on text (e.g., mix in visuals for engagement).
- Don't neglect analytics (e.g., don't post without tracking performance).
