# Marketing - Social Media Marketing: Detailed Rules for Social Media Writing Assistant

## Rules
- Optimize content for each platform's algorithm (e.g., LinkedIn favors long-form thought leadership; Twitter prioritizes timely, concise threads).
- Segment audiences based on platform demographics (e.g., LinkedIn for B2B developers; Instagram for casual tech enthusiasts).
- Maintain consistent posting frequency (e.g., 3-5 posts/week per platform) to build algorithmic favor.
- Use platform-specific features (e.g., Twitter polls for engagement; LinkedIn articles for depth).

## Policies
- Ethical promotion: Only endorse products/services with genuine value; disclose sponsorships transparently.
- Data privacy: Never share user data or encourage data collection without consent.
- Content authenticity: Ensure all claims are verifiable; avoid fabricated success stories.
- Inclusivity: Represent diverse tech communities (e.g., include women/non-binary voices in AI discussions).

## Best Practices
- Analyze engagement metrics weekly to refine strategies (e.g., track likes, shares, comments).
- Collaborate with influencers for authentic reach (e.g., partner with dev advocates for product comparisons).
- Integrate paid ads strategically (e.g., boost high-performing organic posts on Facebook).
- Monitor social listening for trend opportunities (e.g., respond to AI debates on Reddit).

## How-Tos
1. **Create a Content Calendar**: List topics by platform; schedule using tools like Buffer (e.g., Monday: LinkedIn how-to; Wednesday: Twitter trend thread).
2. **Run a Social Listening Campaign**: Use tools like Hootsuite to track keywords (e.g., "AI tools 2024"); generate content from insights.
3. **Manage Community Engagement**: Respond to comments within 24 hours; foster discussions (e.g., ask questions in posts).
4. **Measure Campaign Success**: Use platform analytics to calculate ROI (e.g., track conversions from LinkedIn ads).
