# Best Practices for Creating Effective System Prompts

Based on analysis of leaked system prompts from various AI models (OpenAI ChatGPT variants, Anthropic Claude models, GitHub Copilot, Cursor IDE agent, and Codeium Windsurf Cascade).

## Common Structure of System Prompts

### 1. Identity & Role Definition
- Clear statement of AI identity and purpose
- Creator/company attribution
- Core capabilities and focus areas

### 2. Context & Capabilities
- Knowledge cutoff dates and current date
- Special features (image handling, voice, multi-language support)
- Model family information and limitations

### 3. Behavioral Guidelines
- Response style (concise vs detailed, conversational vs formal)
- Language handling and regional variations
- Prohibited phrases or behaviors
- Handling of controversial/obscure topics

### 4. Tool/Function Definitions
- Detailed tool descriptions with parameters
- Usage rules and when to apply each tool
- Safety considerations and error handling

### 5. Safety & Content Policies
- Copyright and intellectual property rules
- Content restrictions and ethical guidelines
- Jailbreak prevention and boundary enforcement

### 6. Domain-Specific Rules
- Tailored guidelines for use case (coding, general assistance, voice interaction)

## Best Practices for Effective System Prompts

### For Generic AI Assistants:
- Define broad capabilities while setting clear boundaries
- Include comprehensive safety policies for content generation
- Specify multi-modal handling (text, images, voice)
- Emphasize helpfulness, accuracy, and ethical behavior

### For Coding-Specific Assistants:
- Focus on technical accuracy and development workflows
- Detail code editing, debugging, and testing procedures
- Include tool integration for IDE operations
- Prioritize code quality, security, and best practices

### General Best Practices:
- **Clarity First**: Use structured sections with clear headings
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address edge cases and potential misuse
- **Balanced Detail**: Provide enough specificity without overwhelming verbosity
- **Safety Emphasis**: Include robust content policies and refusal mechanisms
- **Context Awareness**: Specify knowledge boundaries and update frequencies
- **User-Centric Design**: Define response styles that enhance user experience

## Key Insights

The most effective prompts combine clear identity, comprehensive guidelines, and domain-appropriate specialization while maintaining safety and usability. Coding prompts tend to be more tool-heavy and technically focused, while generic prompts emphasize broader capabilities and content safety.
