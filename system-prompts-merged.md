# Best Practices for Creating Effective System Prompts

Based on analysis of leaked system prompts from various AI models (OpenAI ChatGPT variants, Anthropic Claude models, GitHub Copilot, Cursor IDE agent, Codeium Windsurf Cascade, and other providers), here's the general structure and best practices for creating effective system prompts.

## Common Structure of System Prompts

### 1. Identity & Role Definition
- Clear statement of AI identity and purpose (e.g., "You are [AI Name], a [description] built by [company]")
- Creator/company attribution
- Core capabilities and focus areas
- Personality traits and behavioral guidelines
- Knowledge boundaries and capabilities

### 2. Context & Capabilities
- Knowledge cutoff dates and current date
- Special features (image handling, voice, multi-language support)
- Model family information and limitations

### 3. Behavioral Guidelines
- Response style (concise vs detailed, conversational vs formal)
- Language handling and regional variations
- Prohibited phrases or behaviors
- Handling of controversial/obscure topics
- Interaction patterns and user communication guidelines
- Error handling and fallback behaviors

### 4. Tool/Function Definitions
- Detailed tool descriptions with parameters and schemas
- Usage rules, examples, and when to apply each tool
- Safety considerations, restrictions, and error handling

### 5. Safety & Content Policies
- Knowledge cutoff dates (if not covered above)
- Content restrictions, safety guidelines, and ethical boundaries
- Handling of sensitive topics, harmful content, and edge cases
- Copyright and intellectual property rules
- Jailbreak prevention and boundary enforcement

### 6. Domain-Specific Rules
- Specialized capabilities for particular use cases
- Tool usage policies and workflows
- Tailored guidelines for use case (coding, general assistance, voice interaction)
- Context-specific guidelines

## Generic vs Specific Use Cases

### Generic Prompts (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o):
- Broad toolsets covering search, code execution, file operations
- Flexible across multiple domains
- General conversation and reasoning capabilities
- Comprehensive safety policies for wide-ranging interactions

### Specific Use Cases (e.g., Claude Code):
- Narrow focus on particular domains (coding, CLI operations)
- Specialized tools optimized for the use case
- Domain-specific safety rules and conventions
- Streamlined workflows for efficiency

## Best Practices for Effective System Prompts

### For Generic AI Assistants:
- Define broad capabilities while setting clear boundaries
- Include comprehensive safety policies for content generation
- Specify multi-modal handling (text, images, voice)
- Emphasize helpfulness, accuracy, and ethical behavior

### For Coding-Specific Assistants:
- Focus on technical accuracy and development workflows
- Detail code editing, debugging, and testing procedures
- Include tool integration for IDE operations
- Prioritize code quality, security, and best practices

### General Best Practices:
- **Progressive Structure**: Start with identity and core capabilities, layer safety policies and restrictions, define tools and behavioral guidelines, end with domain-specific instructions
- **Comprehensive Safety**: Include detailed content policies, define clear boundaries for harmful or inappropriate content, provide guidance for edge cases and ambiguous requests
- **Tool Clarity**: Specify exact parameters and return formats, include usage examples and restrictions, define when and how to use each tool
- **Behavioral Consistency**: Establish clear tone and communication style, define formatting requirements (markdown, citations, etc.), include examples of proper vs improper responses
- **Domain Optimization**: Tailor prompts to specific use cases while maintaining flexibility, include domain-specific tools and workflows, balance specialization with general capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Define fallback behaviors for tool failures, include guidance for ambiguous or edge case requests, provide clear escalation paths
- **Version Control & Maintenance**: Include version numbers and update mechanisms, document changes and deprecations, allow for prompt evolution and improvement
- **Clarity First**: Use structured sections with clear headings
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address edge cases and potential misuse
- **Balanced Detail**: Provide enough specificity without overwhelming verbosity
- **Safety Emphasis**: Include robust content policies and refusal mechanisms
- **Context Awareness**: Specify knowledge boundaries and update frequencies
- **User-Centric Design**: Define response styles that enhance user experience

## Key Insights

The most effective prompts combine clear identity, comprehensive guidelines, and domain-appropriate specialization while maintaining safety and usability. Coding prompts tend to be more tool-heavy and technically focused, while generic prompts emphasize broader capabilities and content safety. This structure ensures prompts are comprehensive, safe, and effective across different AI applications while maintaining clarity and consistency.
