# System Prompts Analysis: Structure and Best Practices

Based on analysis of leaked system prompts across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and other providers, here's the general structure and best practices for creating effective system prompts.

## Common Structure Components

### 1. Identity & Role Definition
- Clear statement: "You are [AI Name], a [description] built by [company]"
- Personality traits and behavioral guidelines
- Knowledge boundaries and capabilities

### 2. Safety & Content Policies
- Knowledge cutoff dates
- Content restrictions and safety guidelines
- Handling of sensitive topics, harmful content, and edge cases

### 3. Tool/Function Specifications
- Detailed tool definitions with parameters and schemas
- Usage guidelines and examples
- Safety checks and restrictions

### 4. Behavioral Instructions
- Response style, tone, and formatting requirements
- Interaction patterns and user communication guidelines
- Error handling and fallback behaviors

### 5. Domain-Specific Instructions
- Specialized capabilities for particular use cases
- Tool usage policies and workflows
- Context-specific guidelines

## Generic vs Specific Use Cases

### Generic Prompts (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o):
- Broad toolsets covering search, code execution, file operations
- Flexible across multiple domains
- General conversation and reasoning capabilities
- Comprehensive safety policies for wide-ranging interactions

### Specific Use Cases (e.g., Claude Code):
- Narrow focus on particular domains (coding, CLI operations)
- Specialized tools optimized for the use case
- Domain-specific safety rules and conventions
- Streamlined workflows for efficiency

## Best Practices for Effective System Prompts

### 1. Progressive Structure
- Start with identity and core capabilities
- Layer safety policies and restrictions
- Define tools and behavioral guidelines
- End with domain-specific instructions

### 2. Comprehensive Safety
- Include detailed content policies
- Define clear boundaries for harmful or inappropriate content
- Provide guidance for edge cases and ambiguous requests

### 3. Tool Clarity
- Specify exact parameters and return formats
- Include usage examples and restrictions
- Define when and how to use each tool

### 4. Behavioral Consistency
- Establish clear tone and communication style
- Define formatting requirements (markdown, citations, etc.)
- Include examples of proper vs improper responses

### 5. Domain Optimization
- Tailor prompts to specific use cases while maintaining flexibility
- Include domain-specific tools and workflows
- Balance specialization with general capabilities

### 6. Error Handling
- Define fallback behaviors for tool failures
- Include guidance for ambiguous or edge case requests
- Provide clear escalation paths

### 7. Version Control & Maintenance
- Include version numbers and update mechanisms
- Document changes and deprecations
- Allow for prompt evolution and improvement

This structure ensures prompts are comprehensive, safe, and effective across different AI applications while maintaining clarity and consistency.
