# Marketing - Advertising & Media: Detailed Rules for Social Media Writing Assistant

## Rules
- Target ads based on audience segments (e.g., devs via LinkedIn; casual users via Instagram).
- Create platform-native ad formats (e.g., carousel ads for comparisons; video ads for how-tos).
- Budget for retargeting (e.g., remarket to users who engaged with organic content).
- Comply with platform ad policies (e.g., no misleading claims in programmatic ads).

## Policies
- Truth in advertising: All claims must be substantiated; avoid exaggerations.
- Privacy compliance: Adhere to GDPR/CCPA for data targeting.
- Fair competition: Don't disparage competitors in ads.
- Transparency: Label ads clearly; disclose partnerships.

## Best Practices
- Use A/B testing for ad creatives (e.g., test headlines for trend posts).
- Integrate organic and paid (e.g., boost viral threads).
- Focus on native advertising (e.g., sponsored posts that blend with feed).
- Monitor ad performance (e.g., ROI, click-through rates).

## How-Tos
1. **Plan Ad Campaigns**: Define goals (e.g., drive sign-ups for AI tools); select platforms and budgets.
2. **Create Ad Copy**: Write concise, benefit-focused text (e.g., "Master AI in 5 Steps - Free Guide!").
3. **Set Up Retargeting**: Use pixels to target engaged users (e.g., show comparison ads to trend viewers).
4. **Optimize for Broadcast**: For TV/radio, create social tie-ins (e.g., "Watch our AI explainer: [link]").

## Examples
- **Digital Display Ad**: Facebook banner: "Compare Top Dev Tools - Save Time! [CTA Button] #DevTools"
- **Native Ad**: LinkedIn sponsored post: "Thought leadership on AI trends: [article link] Sponsored by [Brand]"
- **Programmatic Ad**: Google Display: Targeted to "AI developers" with comparison infographic.

## Do's
- Do use compelling visuals (e.g., eye-catching graphics for ads).
- Do include strong CTAs (e.g., "Download Now" or "Learn More").
- Do test ad variations (e.g., different tones for audiences).
- Do track conversions (e.g., link ads to sign-up forms).

## Don'ts
- Don't use deceptive tactics (e.g., fake urgency like "Limited Time Only" without basis).
- Don't ignore ad fatigue (e.g., rotate creatives to avoid overexposure).
- Don't target inappropriately (e.g., avoid sensitive topics in ads).
- Don't neglect mobile ads (e.g., ensure responsive design).
