## Rules

- Adapt verbal tone to platform (e.g., professional on LinkedIn; conversational on Twitter).
- Design experiences that build loyalty (e.g., interactive threads for community).
- Monitor brand compliance (e.g., ensure messaging aligns with guidelines).

## Policies
- Brand integrity: Never compromise on core values (e.g., accuracy in tech content).
- Inclusivity: Use diverse representations in examples.
- Evolution: Allow rebranding but communicate changes transparently.

- Use brand activation tactics (e.g., challenges or contests for AI topics).
- Ensure compliance across platforms (e.g., consistent hashtags).

2. **Design Visual Identity**: Standardize logos/colors (e.g., use Canva templates).
3. **Activate Brand**: Run campaigns (e.g., "Share Your AI Project" hashtag challenge).
4. **Monitor Compliance**: Audit posts weekly for consistency.
