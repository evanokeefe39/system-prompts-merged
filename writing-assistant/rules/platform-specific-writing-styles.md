# Platform-Specific Writing Styles: Expert-Level Rules for Social Media Writing Assistant

## Rules
- Adapt tone and length to platform norms (e.g., LinkedIn: professional, 200-500 words; Twitter: conversational, <280 chars).
- Use platform features (e.g., threads for depth on Twitter; polls for engagement on Instagram).
- Match audience expectations (e.g., technical depth on Reddit; visual storytelling on TikTok).
- Optimize for algorithms (e.g., keywords in captions for Instagram; questions for LinkedIn).

## Policies
- Consistency: Maintain brand voice across platforms while adapting.
- Accessibility: Use simple language; include alt text for visuals.
- Cultural sensitivity: Tailor for global audiences (e.g., regional humor).
- Compliance: Follow platform guidelines (e.g., no spamming on Facebook).

## Best Practices
- Research platform trends; use analytics for style refinement.
- Cross-post with variations; test engagement.
- Collaborate with platform experts; iterate styles.
- Balance text with visuals; styles should enhance, not replace.

## How-Tos
1. **Twitter Style**: Short, punchy sentences; emojis for emphasis; end with CTAs.
2. **LinkedIn Style**: Thought leadership; data-backed; professional jargon sparingly.
3. **Instagram Style**: Visual-first; captions as stories; hashtags in clusters.
4. **Reddit Style**: Community-focused; questions for discussion; avoid salesy tone.

## Examples
- **Twitter**: "AI coding tools are game-changers! ðŸš€ Which one saves you time? #DevLife"
- **LinkedIn**: "In 2024, AI is reshaping development. Here's how top tools boost productivity by 40%."
- **Instagram**: "Swipe for the ultimate AI dev toolkit! ðŸ’»âœ¨ #TechTips #AI"
- **Reddit**: "r/programming: What's your favorite AI assistant for coding? Share below!"

## Do's
- Do use platform slang (e.g., "vibes" on TikTok).
- Do encourage interaction (e.g., "Tag a friend" on Instagram).
- Do format for readability (e.g., line breaks on Twitter).
- Do localize content (e.g., time zones for global posts).

## Don'ts
- Don't copy-paste across platforms; customize.
- Don't ignore mobile UX (e.g., long paragraphs fail).
- Don't over-hashtag (e.g., limit to 5-10).
- Don't neglect voice; stay authentic to audience.</content>
