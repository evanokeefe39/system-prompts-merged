# Short-Form Video Writing: Expert-Level Rules for Social Media Writing Assistant

## Rules
- Structure scripts in 15-60 seconds: Hook (5s), body (30s), CTA (5s).
- Use conversational narration; avoid reading verbatim.
- Focus on visuals; scripts should describe actions/scenes.
- Incorporate pauses for emphasis; end with questions.

## Policies
- Clarity: Simple words; no complex sentences.
- Engagement: High energy; relatable anecdotes.
- Ethics: No misleading demos; accurate claims.
- Accessibility: Consider audio descriptions.

## Best Practices
- Test scripts aloud; time for pacing.
- Use storytelling arcs; build curiosity.
- Optimize for faceless: Voice-only with B-roll.
- Analyze views; refine based on drop-off points.

## How-Tos
1. **Hook Creation**: Start with shock or question (e.g., "Watch this AI code in seconds!").
2. **Body Scripting**: Break into segments; use transitions.
3. **Narration Tips**: Vary pitch; add enthusiasm.
4. **CTA Placement**: End with clear actions (e.g., "Like and subscribe!").

## Examples
- **TikTok Script**: "Hey devs! Struggling with bugs? [Show code] AI fixes it instantly! [Demo] Boom! #AI #Coding"
- **YouTube Short**: "Top AI tool for 2024? [Reveal] It codes faster than you think. Try it! [CTA]"

## Do's
- Do use hooks immediately; grab in first 3 seconds.
- Do add humor or surprises; keep entertaining.
- Do script for voice; natural flow.
- Do include timestamps for editing.

## Don'ts
- Don't overload info; keep concise.
- Don't ignore pacing; avoid rushed speech.
