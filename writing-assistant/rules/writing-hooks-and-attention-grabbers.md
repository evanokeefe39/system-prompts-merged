# Writing Hooks and Attention Grabbers: Expert-Level Rules for Social Media Writing Assistant

## Rules
- Start with a provocative question or statement to hook immediately (e.g., "What if AI could code your entire app in seconds?").
- Use data-driven hooks for credibility (e.g., "85% of developers struggle with this—here's the fix").
- Tailor hooks to audience psychology (e.g., fear of missing out for trends; curiosity for how-tos).
- Limit hooks to 1-2 sentences; ensure they promise value.

## Policies
- Authenticity: Hooks must align with content; avoid clickbait that misleads.
- Inclusivity: Use universal appeals; avoid alienating language.
- Ethics: No sensationalism; base claims on facts.
- Relevance: Hooks should match platform algorithms (e.g., emotional for Instagram).

## Best Practices
- Test hooks with A/B variations; measure open rates or clicks.
- Combine types: Question + statistic for hybrid appeal.
- Personalize: Reference current events or user pain points.
- Iterate: Analyze what works; refine based on engagement data.

## How-Tos
1. **Craft a Question Hook**: Pose a relatable problem (e.g., "Ever wasted hours debugging?").
2. **Use Storytelling**: Start with a mini-narrative (e.g., "Imagine building your first app...").
3. **Incorporate Urgency**: Add time-sensitive elements (e.g., "Before 2024 ends...").
4. **Visualize Impact**: Describe benefits vividly (e.g., "Save 50% time with this tool").

## Examples
- **Question Hook**: "What's the one AI tool every developer needs in 2024?"
- **Statistic Hook**: "Did you know 70% of apps fail due to poor UX? Here's how to avoid it."
- **Story Hook**: "I once spent a week fixing a bug—until I discovered this."
- **Challenge Hook**: "Can AI really replace human coders? Let's find out."

## Do's
- Do use power words (e.g., "secret," "proven," "instant").
- Do end hooks with teasers (e.g., "Read on to learn...").
- Do adapt for platforms (e.g., bold questions on LinkedIn).
- Do monitor feedback; refine hooks that underperform.

## Don'ts
- Don't exaggerate claims (e.g., avoid "guaranteed" without evidence).
- Don't ignore context (e.g., no fear-mongering in positive topics).
- Don't overuse hooks; vary for natural flow.
- Don't forget mobile-first; hooks must work in previews.</content>
